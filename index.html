                    <h3>Idea</h3>
                    <p>I came up with this idea through personal necessity. I love watching tv, but so often it's tough to find something good to watch. There are lots of similar sites out there, but they all seem overly complicated; asking specifics about genre or certification (amongst a myriad of other things). My idea is simple; what have you enjoyed before? Here are some similar shows to choose from!</p>
                    <h3>Designs</h3>
                    <p>I had a good idea in my mind of how I wanted the site to look. I design and build all sites that I work on using the 'mobile first' methodology. I knew that this site more than most, would get a lot of traffic via mobile and tablet. Most people sat on their sofa wondering what to watch tend to have their phone or tablet to hand! I fleshed out some wireframes and user flow (<a href='../img/something2watch/Something2Watch_small.pdf' target="_">small</a>, <a href='../img/something2watch/Something2Watch_medium.pdf' target="_">medium</a> and <a href='../img/something2watch/Something2Watch_large.pdf' target="_">large</a>) in Balsamiq and selected the font and colour with inspiration from a recent copy of Web Designer magazine.</p>
                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p>The biggest challenge was finding the right API to get the data. I wasn't able to find a single data source that gave me everything I wanted. <a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3" target="_">themoviedb</a> came close; it provided a comprehensive query endpoint to find suggestions using any number of different metrics. The one downside was that it uses its own rating system, rather than the more familiar, and much more widely used, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. I settled on using <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/" target"_">omdbapi</a> for the basic search and most of the UI data, including the all-important "sort by rating"), but utilised themoviedb for the impressive search api.</p>
                    <p>The second challenge came with extracting the data out of the APIs. Because of the need to switch between the two api's to retrieve and display the results, there are 5 asynchronous api calls, that all depend on the previous to work. Initially I tried doing this in the redux container, checking that the previous API had returned its result using componentWillReceiveProps and firing off the next call when it had; that got very messy very fast. Instead I decided on chaining promises in the action creator. I felt this was the best all round solution as it keeps the container concise whilst not having an overly complicated action.</p>
                    <h3>Further Development Ideas</h3>
                    <p>If I can find an API that provides the data, I would love to be able to show which platforms each result is available on; whether it be Netflix, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, etc...</p>

                <div>
                  <h2>IfOnly</h2>
                  <div>
                    <h3>Idea</h3>
                    <p>I came up with the idea for this site when chatting to a friend; "I wonder, if someone had invested some money in Apple for me on the day I was born, what would it be worth now?". It turns out, it would be worth about 150 times more today than it was then.</p>
                    <h3>Designs</h3>
                    <p>I think I spent more time thinking about how to make this idea fun for the end user, the actual design of it; and honestly? I think that shows. However, I am very pleased with the story telling aspect of it.</p>
                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p>The hardest part was the time spent on getting the inputs to work how I wanted them to. They grow and shrink to fit the text that the user adds. They are responsive across different viewports, utilising mobile and tablet devices native datetime pickers, and a jQuery plugin to achieve the same thing on desktop.</p>
                    <p>I also took care when it came to loading the background image; there are 5 potential images that can be used. The site randomises which one is displayed each time the page is loaded. The image is then loaded asynchronously and fades in when it has finished downloading. It turns out to be a fairly simple bit of javascript, but it took a decent amount of thought!</p>
                    <h3>Further Development Ideas</h3>
                    <p>I've already done some further development; I added the bottom section calculation to show the optimum date to cash out! I also added the UK FTSE100 stock exchange to go with the existing US S&P500. I have some further ideas for development; I would like to redesign the UI to use more material design aspects as I have never been totally happy with it, especially the loading spinner!. I would also like to add Crypto Currencies to the list of available investments.</p>
